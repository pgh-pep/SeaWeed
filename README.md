## About Us

Pitt Electric Propulsion is the University of Pittsburgh's first electric vehicle team. We are a student-run not-for-profit engineering team interested in the future of electric vehicle and transportation technology. We compete annually in the American Society of Naval Engineers' [Promoting Electric Propulsion for Small Craft Competition](https://www.navalengineers.org/Education/Promoting-Electric-Propulsion-PEP) and RoboNation's [RoboBoat](https://roboboat.org/) competition. In addition to this autonomous electric boat, we are developing an electric C-Stock racing boat. Please visit our website or contact us to learn more about the team!
